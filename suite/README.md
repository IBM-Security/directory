# IBM Security Directory Suite

This directory contains IBM Security Directory Suite tools, tuning guides and other helpful documentation.

Please use the Issue tab to report problems, offer suggestions, etc.

If the Directory appliance is configured to use a remote database, many of the tools and database tuning scripts will be useful when run on the database instance.
